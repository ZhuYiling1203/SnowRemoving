In recent years, with the development of information-oriented society, the surveillance cameras have been widely installed for various purposes .
However, in the area of heavy snowfall, it is difficult to monitor with surveillance cameras due to the effect of snowfall．
Therefore, various studies have been conducted to eliminate snow．

However, in the conventional method, there are various problems such as that snow particles passing near the camera are larger 
and cannot be distinguished from a moving object,
and a part of moving objects, such as a car, might be incomplete after processed in the result video image .

To deal with these problems, in this paper, we proposed a snow removing method that can be applied to moving objects by using snow discrimination based on the information of moving objects which are used difference processing, 
and using the difference in the speed of moving objects between adjacent frames. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, 
several experiments were performed using video images of actual surveillance cameras．
On the result of the experiment of video images taken by actual surveillance cameras, which cars are running on the snow in various of circumstances, 
such as on the normal road, on the a curve of the highway and in the distance, 
confirmed that the proposed method can be applied to snow removal of surveillance camera video images in various environments regardless of the size of snow.
